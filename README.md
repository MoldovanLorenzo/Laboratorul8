## Operatii Class Explanation

### `double add(double n1, double n2) throws Exception`

This method takes two double values, `n1` and `n2`, as input and calculates their sum. It also checks for specific conditions:

- If both `n1` and `n2` are equal to 0, it throws an exception with the message "Numerele sunt nule."
- If the sum of `n1` and `n2` is equal to positive infinity, it throws an exception with the message "suma celor 2 numere este egala cu +infinit."
- If the sum of `n1` and `n2` is equal to negative infinity, it throws an exception with the message "suma celor 2 numere este egala cu -infinit."

### `double divide(double n1, double n2) throws Exception`

This method takes two double values, `n1` and `n2`, as input and calculates their division. It also checks for specific conditions:

- If both `n1` and `n2` are equal to 0, it throws an exception with the message "Numerele sunt nule."
- If the sum of `n1` and `n2` is equal to positive infinity, it throws an exception with the message "suma celor 2 numere este egala cu +infinit."
- If the sum of `n1` and `n2` is equal to negative infinity, it throws an exception with the message "suma celor 2 numere este egala cu -infinit."

### `double average(List<Double> valori) throws Exception`

This method calculates the average of a list of double values. It takes a list of double values, `valori`, as input. The method iterates through the list, summing up all the values and then divides by the number
